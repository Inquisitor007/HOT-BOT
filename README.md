# Near Protocol: Hot Wallet Auto-Claim Bot

This Python script automates claiming HOT tokens from the Herewallet app, which operates on the NEAR Protocol. The app allows users to "mine" HOT tokens, which are distributed on the NEAR blockchain. For maximum rewards, users must log in regularly to claim tokens. This script streamlines the process, ensuring you receive the most HOT tokens possible. It's especially useful for those with multiple accounts, cycling through each account (identified by 12-word seed phrases), logging in, and claiming tokens when a wallet reaches capacity. If a wallet isn't full, the script calculates the remaining time and waits before retrying, optimizing network efficiency.

Note: The Claim HOT game has previously overloaded both the NEAR Protocol and its Content Distribution Network (CDN). If you encounter frequent errors, it would be best to give the Claim HOT developers time to resolve their issues before retrying the script. I will do my best to update this repository if the game creators release code changes.

## üöÄ How To Use

### Linux Users - This guide is based on installation on an Ubuntu VPS server

1. **If required, install Python & PIP:**

- Open a new command prompt window. 
- VPS users should make an SSH connection via PuTTy or similar.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip
   python3 --version
   ```

2. **Download the Chrome `.deb` package:**

   ```bash
   wget -O /tmp/chrome.deb https://mirror.cs.uchicago.edu/google-chrome/pool/main/g/google-chrome-stable/google-chrome-stable_114.0.5735.198-1_amd64.deb
   sudo apt install -y /tmp/chrome.deb
   rm /tmp/chrome.deb
   ```
3. **Download Chromedriver:**

   ```bash
	sudo apt install unzip
	wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/114.0.5735.90/chromedriver_linux64.zip
	unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
	sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
	sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
	chromedriver --version
	```

4. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y git
   git clone https://github.com/thebrumby/HotWalletBot.git
   ```

5. **Switch to the repository directory:**
   ```bash
   cd HotWalletBot
   ```

6. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install selenium Pillow
   ```

7. **Run the Python script or use the unattended method below:**
   ```bash
   python3 claim.py
   ```


# How to leave the script running for unattended claims

If you want the script to run continuously, even after disconnecting from the server, use screen:

- Install screen if required: ```sudo apt install -y screen```
- Create session: ```screen -S hot_wallet```
- Check you are in the HotWalletBot directory or ```cd HotWalletBot```
- Start the script: ```python3 claim.py``` or ```python claim.py```
- To exit the session and leave it running in the background CTRL+A+D
- To later resume session: ```screen -r```

Note: You have two options to integrate your accounts:
1) Create a seed.txt file in the same directory as claim.py
2) Run claim.py and you will be prompted to enter the seed phrase. It will check you entered 12 words and create seed.txt

Each seed phrase should be 12 words, each separated by a space.
As mentioned earlier, you may enter more than one seed phrase, with each one on a separate line.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: While this Python script is openly available on GitHub, transparent in its code, and devoid of any malicious content, it's important to understand the potential risks. The debugging function of this script generates screenshots at different stages of the login process directly on your local machine. It also stores your seed phrases, unencrypted, in a text file named seed.txt.

‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment:

Given that the script operates locally, there's minimal risk associated with its usage on a personal machine, provided that it is not accessible by others.
Storing sensitive information, such as seed phrases, on a shared computer, especially in an unencrypted text file poses a significant security concern.
Accounts with high monetary value should not be used with this script due to the inherent security risks involved.

üí° Recommendations:

Avoid installing this script on a machine accessible by others, especially in shared or public environments. Refrain from entering seed phrases associated with accounts holding significant monetary value. This script is primarily intended for use in scenarios where security is less critical, such as experimenting with the "Claim Hot" game.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: The developers of this script does not assume responsibility for any misuse or unauthorized access to sensitive information. Users are advised to exercise caution and discretion when utilizing this tool.

By understanding the risks and exercising appropriate caution, users can maximize the benefits of this script while minimizing potential security vulnerabilities. Remember, your security is paramount. Stay vigilant and informed!
